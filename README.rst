# mast-aladin-lite

While we are experimenting with Aladin Lite integration in MAST platforms, this repository can be used to contain:
- documentation
- support code for wrapping and integrating Aladin Lite
- demonstration notebooks

Once design plans become more concrete, we can decide whether to keep using this repository.
